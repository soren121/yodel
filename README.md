# Yodel

Recently, I received a cease-and-desist letter from the legal firm representing Yik Yak, Inc. demanding that I
discontinue distribution of Yodel or face legal action.

I maintain that my work was fully legal and permissible. However, I do not have an opportunity to debate the claims
made against me without fighting them in civil court, and as Yik Yak and their lawyers no doubt deduced before 
employing this threat, I currently lack both the time and resources to do so, so I have no choice but to comply with 
their demands.

The C&D letter I was sent is included here in this repository for your perusal.

To my 30,000 users and everyone who helped out and sent in bug reports, thank you so much. You guys have been awesome. 
I'm truly sorry to be letting all of you down.
